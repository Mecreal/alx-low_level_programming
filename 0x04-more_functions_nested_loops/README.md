### 0. isupper
**File:** `0-isupper.c`  
- A function that checks for uppercase characters.
- Prototype: `int _isupper(int c);`
- Returns 1 if `c` is uppercase, 0 otherwise.

### 1. isdigit
**File:** `1-isdigit.c`  
- A function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
- Prototype: `int _isdigit(int c);`
- Returns 1 if `c` is a digit, 0 otherwise.

### 2. Collaboration is multiplication
**File:** `2-mul.c`  
- A function that multiplies two integers.
- Prototype: `int mul(int a, int b);`

### 3. The numbers speak for themselves
**File:** `3-print_numbers.c`  
- A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: `void print_numbers(void);`
- Uses `_putchar` twice in the code.

### 4. I believe in numbers and signs
**File:** `4-print_most_numbers.c`  
- A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: `void print_most_numbers(void);`
- Uses `_putchar` twice in the code.

### 5. Numbers constitute the only universal language
**File:** `5-more_numbers.c`  
- A function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: `void more_numbers(void);`
- Uses `_putchar` three times in the code.

### 6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
**File:** `6-print_line.c`  
- A function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
- Prototype: `void print_line(int n);`
- Uses `_putchar` to print where `n` is the number of times the character `_` should be printed.

### 7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe
**File:** `7-print_diagonal.c`  
- A function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
- Prototype: `void print_diagonal(int n);`
- Uses `_putchar` to print where `n` is the number of times the character `\` should be printed.

### 8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch
**File:** `8-print_square.c`  
- A function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: `void print_square(int size);`
- Uses `_putchar` to print where `size` is the size of the square.

### 9. Fizz-Buzz
**File:** `9-fizz_buzz.c`  
- A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
- For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For the multiples of five, print "Buzz".
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

### 10. Triangles
**File:** `10-print_triangle.c`  
- A function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: `void print_triangle(int size);`
- Uses `_putchar` to print where `size` is the size of the triangle.

# 0x0F Function pointers

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
### General


* What are function pointers and how to use them
* What does a function pointer exactly hold
* Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory



## Tasks

###   0. What's my name 
Write a function that prints a name.

*    Prototype: void print_name(char *name, void (*f)(char *));

Repo:

*    GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
*    Directory: 0x0F-function_pointers
*    File: 0-print_name.c



### 1. Pi 
Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.

#### Repo:
*    GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
*    Directory: 0x0D-preprocessor
*    File: 1-pi.h



### 2. File name 
Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

* You are allowed to use the standard library

Repo:

* GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
* Directory: 0x0D-preprocessor
* File: 2-main.c



### 3. Function-like macro 
Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.

Repo:

* GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
* Directory: 0x0D-preprocessor
* File: 3-function_like_macro.h

###  4. SUM
Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.

Repo:

* GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
* Directory: 0x0D-preprocessor
* File: 4-sum.h
